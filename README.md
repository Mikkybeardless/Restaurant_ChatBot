# Restaurant chatbot
Welcome to my awesome project's README. Here you'll find everything you need to get started.

## Overview: 
This project was created to perform the following tasks

- Attend to customers, taking and giving replies to orders based on a select menu.

- It has a login page that grabs the customer name and sends it in the request query

- This query is grabbed from the frontend and sent to the server using a query string parser (qs CDN)

- When a user joins, the server sends a message to the frontend after saving the username and giving the user a session ID. The frontend then sends the welcome message with the user name to the customer

- The bot has specified valid inputs that output a message to the customer using a switch statement

- Embedded switch for placing an order allowing the user to select meal type and store the data in an in-memory storage system.
